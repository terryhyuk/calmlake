## How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
   `git clone https://github.com/terryhyuk/calmlake.git`
2. Install dependencies  
   `flutter pub get`
3. Run the app  
   `flutter run`
4. Backend setup required for full functionality:
   - The backend (FastAPI) source code is in the `/pythonSpace` directory.
   - To run the backend:
     1. Open a terminal and go to the `pythonSpace` folder.
     2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
        `python3 -m venv venv`
        `source venv/bin/activate`
     3. Install dependencies:
        `pip install -r requirements.txt`
     4. Start the FastAPI server:
        `uvicorn calmlake:app --reload`
   - The Flutter app uses Firebase directly; there is **no separate Firebase folder**.  
     Make sure your Firebase project is set up and configured in your Flutter app as described in the Flutter/Firebase documentation.
